			<p class="text">Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, who became South Africa's first black head of state, and teh first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His primary focus while in government was dismantling the institutional racism of apartheid and fostering racial reconciliation.</p>
			<p class="text"> He was born in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, and was given the forename Rolihlahla, which means "troublemaker". His great-grandfather was the king of the Thembu people, and although Mandela was inelegible to inherit the throne, his early life was dominated by traditional Thembu custom and taboo. </p>
			<p class="text">He studied law at the University of Witwatersrand, where he was teh only black African student. It was here that he was among a delegation to start a youth wing to mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjegation, the first step in his political career.</p>
