			<p class="text">Thomas Jefferson was the first Repulican president of the USA, and was responsible for the purchase of Louisiana from the French, which almost doubled the size of country's territory. He was one of the founding fathers of the United States of America, and was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
			<p class="text">Jefferson grew up in the Colony of Virginia, at the family home. His father died when Jefferson was 14. Jefferson was an avid reader and an academic throughout his life, mastering French, Greek and violin alongside mathematics, metaphysics and philosophy.</p>
			<p class="text">Jefferson's pride and joy, outside of politics, was his primary residence that he started work on in the late 1760s, Monticello. Much of his life was spent on creating and improving the house and vast grounds. the effort that Jefferson put into Monticello showed his deeply divided personality; he struggled throughout his life to choose between politics and family life, both of which he loved passionately.</p>
